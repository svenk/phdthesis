 
The aeibibtex repository with its very long aeireferences.bib file (79983 lines,
2.9MB in size, MD5SUM e4fb25d9b70091b8aa278e97027f1bb0,
commit 20c682543d77c393fce694c273503fe6b3bf6a67) was used extensively in this
file, but is not open sourced from its authors. Therefore, we do *NOT* include
it in this repository.

You find the compiled papers in the phdthesis.bbl file.
