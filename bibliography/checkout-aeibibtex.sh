# AEIBibtex is the Bibtex repository of Luciano, which was probably formerly
# the Bibtex repository of the whole Albert Einstein Institute.
#
# Confusingly, the Trento bibtex repository is almost identical to AEIBibtex
# which is probably because Olindo Zanotti was importing the bibtex keys at one
# day. It is in fact out of sync.
#
# The AEIBibtex is available as:

git clone git@gitlab.th.physik.uni-frankfurt.de:aeibibtex/bibtex.git aeibibtex
